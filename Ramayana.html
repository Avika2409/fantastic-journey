<p>The Ramayana written by Tulsidas known as Ramcharitmanas, is a sixteenth century epic. The story revolves around 
Rama, who was the seventh avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu. He is the central figure of the Hindu epic Ramayana, which is the principal narration of the events connected to his incarnation on Earth, his ideas and his greatness. He was the eldest son of King-
Dashratha-the ruler of Kosala Kingdom. Rama's life and journey is one of adherence to dharma despite harsh tests and obstacles and many pains of life and time. This adherence made him earn name of Maryada Purushottam which literally means The Perfect Man or Lord of Self-Control or Lord of Virtue.</p>
